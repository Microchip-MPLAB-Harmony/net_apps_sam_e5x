follows: \"iperf\": starts the iperf session Use \"iperf -s\" for a server connection or \"iperf -c address\" for a client connection Look at the Iperf Module for examples of iperf benchmarks \"iperfk\" kills an ongoing iperf test This is mainly useful for killing a iperf server waiting for connections But the command could be also used to abort client test \"iperfi -a address\" allows to set the interface to use for iperf when the test is run on a multi-interface host When multiple iperf instabces are used the extra parameter \"-i\" could be used to specify the iperf index to which the command refers to \"iperfs\" command could be used to set the socket TX or RX buffer size dynamically For example: \"iperfs -tx 2048\" Note: The iperf demo uses very few TCP/IP modules to minimize the stack overhead and to obtain good throughput numbers However ICMP server NBNS and Announce modules are enabled to assist in the discovery of the board on the network DHCP client is also enabled for acquiring a valid IP address within the network Some of these modules could be further disabled if they are not used in the specific network environment of the application The data throughput could vary dependent on the iperf socket settings and the network conditions Larger TX and RX buffers will increase the corresponding throughput Various devices on the network on the link between the board and the machine running the iperf application (switches routers etc ) could also affect the throughput User can eliminate these effects by connecting the board running the iperf demo directly to the machine running the test on the PC side (Linux Windows etc ) ",
